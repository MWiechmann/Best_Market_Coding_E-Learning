# Finding the Best Market for an E-Learning Platform
In this project I will be using relatively basic summary statistics to identify the best markets for advertising an e-learning company that offers programming courses.

## Basic assumptions for this project:
* The e-learning company's courses focus on web and mobile development, but some courses are also about data science, game development, and other areas.
* The e-learning company wants to start by identifying the two most promising markets for their product

# Dataset used in this project
I will be using data from [freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/we-asked-20-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-fff5d668969/). Free Code Camp runs a popular Medium publication, so their survey attracted a relatively wide of new coders
The dataset can be obtained [here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey).
